    Don't send NICK messages more than once when we're in channels

    The server was updating its state, then checking for channel members
    who needed to be informed of the nick change. This was causing users
    to get more than one NICK message back whenever they change nicks.

    I moved the state-updating part further down, to prevent this. I also
    added a test for this.
